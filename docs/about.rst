About the project
=================

The *C* standard library, differently from those of more modern programming languages like *Java*, *C++*, *Python* and *Go*,
provides no data structure or algorithmic functionality. Instead, this task is assigned to community as a whole.

The purpose of *YADSL* is to provide data structures and algorithms that are:

* *readable* even for begginers to *C*;
* *reusable* for new and more complex constructions;
* *robust* for large applications.
